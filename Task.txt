As a basis for this home task, you’ll need to create a git repository on git.epam.com / github.com. 
1.	GIT base actions:
•	Clone remote repository using SSH keys;
•	Create 3 commits in “master” branch;
•	Create new “develop” branch and push 2 commits to it;
•	Merge “develop” branch to “master” branch;
2.	GIT advanced actions:
•	Add 2 additional commits to "develop" branch, and 1 additional commit to “master”. Rebase "develop" with new commits from "master";
•	Add 2 additional commits to “develop” branch. Cherry-pick the first commit to “master”. Revert the second commit;
•	Together with your mentor/colleague emulate ‘merge conflict’ situation and resolve this.
